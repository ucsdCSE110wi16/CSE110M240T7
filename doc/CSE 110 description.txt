One of the struggles of being a college student is eating meals that are
both healthy and cheap. Our proposal to remedy this problems is a mobile
application that is essentially a cookbook of various recipes. This
cookbook app would have a database of many recipes with instructions on how
to cook them. The app would also allow you to save recipes that you like
locally to your phone so that you can access them easily. Another feature
of this app would be to take the ingredients that you already have in your
fridge and show the recipes that can be made using them. The app should
have a simplistic design, making it lightweight and easy for the user to
utilize its features. There should also be a wide diversity of recipes that
will fit one's food needs any time of the day. The app's design should be
lightweight and minimalistic, centering around making the information and
recipes easy to access. The app should have a feature that filters the
recipes as well. Some categories could be based on time to prepare, which
meal of the day it is, or what culture the food initially came from.
