Final touches needed:
- tests (Bao)
- recipes should show how much of each ingredient each needs
  in the view
- test how each step looks, given a long step 
  (more than 1 line), make changes if needed
- do the same for ingredients (though less priority,
  assuming that each ingredient name does not need 
  more than one line)
